# World_Weather_Analysis

# Weather_Database
* I used the power of the OpenWeatherMap API to generate random latitude and longitude plots to retrieve nearby cities. This data was used in a dataframe to gain insight into predictable weather patterns throughout the world.

# Vacation_Search
* The gmaps API was used to help the user search for possible destinations based on the weather inputs from their personal taste (minimum and maximum temperatures). Hotel data was also retrieved to allow the users to have a hassle-free approach when booking their trip.

# Vacation_Itinerary
* The directions API was used to help the user create a map of the perfect travel destination based on the previous weather input data.
